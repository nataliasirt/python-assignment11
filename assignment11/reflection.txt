Static visualizations, like those created with Pandas and Matplotlib, are quick to generate and effective for basic data exploration but lack interactivity, limiting user engagement. Interactive visualizations, such as those with Plotly and Dash, allow users to zoom, hover, and filter data, providing a richer experience for exploring complex datasets. Dashboards, like those built with Dash, offer real-time data exploration by enabling dynamic updates through user inputs like dropdowns, making them ideal for monitoring and decision-making.
